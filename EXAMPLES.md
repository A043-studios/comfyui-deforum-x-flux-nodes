## üßÆ Mathematical Expression Library

### Basic Patterns

#### Linear Motion
```python
# Constant speed
translation_x = "0:(t*2)"

# Accelerating
translation_x = "0:(t*t*0.01)"

# Decelerating
translation_x = "0:(100 - (100-t)*(100-t)*0.01)"
```

#### Oscillating Motion
```python
# Simple sine wave
translation_x = "0:(sin(t*0.1)*100)"

# Damped oscillation
translation_x = "0:(sin(t*0.1)*100*exp(-t*0.01))"

# Complex wave
translation_x = "0:(sin(t*0.1)*100 + sin(t*0.3)*30)"
```

#### Circular Motion
```python
# Perfect circle
translation_x = "0:(sin(t*0.1)*100)"
translation_y = "0:(cos(t*0.1)*100)"

# Spiral
translation_x = "0:(sin(t*0.1)*t*0.5)"
translation_y = "0:(cos(t*0.1)*t*0.5)"
```

### Advanced Patterns

#### Easing Functions
```python
# Ease in (slow start)
zoom = "0:(1.0 + (t/100)**2 * 0.5)"

# Ease out (slow end)
zoom = "0:(1.0 + (1-(1-t/100)**2) * 0.5)"

# Ease in-out
zoom = "0:(1.0 + (t/100)**3 * 0.5)" if t < 50 else "0:(1.5 - ((100-t)/100)**3 * 0.5)"
```

#### Noise and Randomness
```python
# Perlin-like noise (approximation)
translation_x = "0:(sin(t*0.1)*100 + sin(t*0.37)*30 + sin(t*0.73)*10)"

# Jitter
angle = "0:(t*2 + sin(t*1.7)*5)"
```

#### Complex Combinations
```python
# Breathing zoom with rotation
zoom = "0:(1.0 + sin(t*0.05)*0.3)"
angle = "0:(t*0.5 + sin(t*0.1)*10)"

# Figure-8 motion
translation_x = "0:(sin(t*0.1)*100)"
translation_y = "0:(sin(t*0.2)*50)"

# Spiral with zoom
translation_x = "0:(sin(t*0.1)*t*0.3)"
translation_y = "0:(cos(t*0.1)*t*0.3)"
zoom = "0:(1.0 + t*0.001)"
```

## üéØ Use Case Examples

### 1. Product Showcase
**Scenario**: Showcase a product with smooth 360¬∞ rotation

```python
# Smooth 360¬∞ rotation
rotation_3d_y = "0:(0), 120:(360)"

# Slight zoom in
zoom = "0:(1.0), 120:(1.2)"

# Prompts
prompts = "0:(professional product photography, clean background, studio lighting)"
```

### 2. Nature Documentary Style
**Scenario**: Wildlife or landscape with cinematic movement

```python
# Slow push-in
translation_z = "0:(0), 300:(200)"

# Gentle pan
rotation_3d_y = "0:(0), 300:(30)"

# Prompts with time progression
prompts = """
0:(serene forest clearing in morning light)
100:(the same forest with dappled afternoon sunlight)
200:(the forest in golden hour)
300:(the forest in twilight)
"""
```

### 3. Abstract Art Generation
**Scenario**: Create flowing abstract patterns

```python
# Complex multi-frequency motion
translation_x = "0:(sin(t*0.08)*150 + sin(t*0.23)*50 + sin(t*0.67)*20)"
translation_y = "0:(cos(t*0.08)*150 + cos(t*0.19)*50 + cos(t*0.71)*20)"
angle = "0:(sin(t*0.05)*180 + t*0.3)"
zoom = "0:(1.0 + sin(t*0.03)*0.4 + sin(t*0.11)*0.2)"

# Abstract prompts
prompts = """
0:(flowing liquid colors, abstract art, vibrant)
60:(geometric patterns, kaleidoscope, colorful)
120:(organic forms, fluid dynamics, artistic)
"""
```

### 4. Architectural Visualization

translation_x = "0:(0), 80:(50), 160:(-30), 240:(0)"

# Natural head movement
rotation_3d_y = "0:(0), 60:(15), 120:(-10), 180:(20), 240:(0)"
rotation_3d_x = "0:(sin(t*0.02)*2)"

# Lighting progression

0:(modern interior, natural daylight, architectural photography)
80:(the same interior, warm afternoon light)
160:(the interior with evening ambient lighting)
240:(the interior with dramatic night lighting)
"""
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Examples

### Common Expression Errors

#### ‚ùå Wrong: Missing parentheses
```python
angle = "0:0, 60:360"  # Missing parentheses
```

#### ‚úÖ Correct: Proper format
```python
angle = "0:(0), 60:(360)"  # Correct format
```

#### ‚ùå Wrong: Invalid function
```python
translation_x = "0:(random()*100)"  # random() not supported
```

#### ‚úÖ Correct: Use supported functions
```python
translation_x = "0:(sin(t*1.7)*100)"  # Use sin for pseudo-random
```

### Performance Optimization Examples

#### For Large Animations (500+ frames):
```python
# Use simpler expressions
angle = "0:(t*0.5)"  # Instead of complex trigonometry

# Reduce parameter complexity
translation_x = "0:(sin(t*0.1)*100)"  # Instead of multiple frequencies
```

#### For Real-time Preview:
- Use preview mode in renderer
- Reduce resolution to 512x512
- Use fewer generation steps (15-20)
